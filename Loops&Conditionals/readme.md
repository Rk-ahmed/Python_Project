# Python_Project

## Overview
Welcome to **Python_Project**!  
This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning **Python from scratch to advanced level**, with a focus on **Data Science** and **Automation**.  
The goal of this project is to apply Python concepts through **real-life examples** and **mini projects**, helping to reinforce learning with practical applications.

---

## 🚀 Objective
- Learn Python fundamentals and advanced concepts step by step.
- Apply Python knowledge in **Data Science**, including data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and basic machine learning.
- Build **automation scripts** to handle real-life tasks efficiently.
- Develop a collection of **mini projects** to demonstrate problem-solving skills.
